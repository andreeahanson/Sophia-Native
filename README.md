Palette Picker was created to help designers and developers pick the perfect color palette for their site or application. The project was developed with Express, Knex, Node.js, and React. It is deployed on Heroku and tested using Supertest. 

## Learning Goals

The primary learning goals for this project are:

* server-side testing
* further understanding of complete CRUD endpoints
* connecting BE & FE repositories using CORS
* multiple environments:
* testing
* making use of automatic continuous integration with TravisCI
* deployment with Heroku

The second focus for this project is developing professional-level workflow habits. This includes:

* using a PR template
* conducting actual code reviews in your PRs
* detailed agile workflow using a kanban system or GH issues
* keeping track of MVP features and nice-to-have features
* agreeing to a commit message template
* exploring git rebase and squashing
* Highly semantic, specific, professional documentation (README, API documentation, etc)

## Challenges

The developers had developed frontend applications and backend applications, but had never before combined backend and frontend. Although it was not challenging, there was a learning curve to overcome. The biggest challenge was understanding how to incorporate the datatable information and format into the frontend.

## Successes

The biggest success was rendering the randomly generated colors and saving the palettes with their associated projects on the backend. Users can also lock colors to create a customized palette.

## Tech Stack

* React
* Redux
* Supertest
* Jest

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
